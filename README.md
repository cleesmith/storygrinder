### Your First Project

> Note: 
> StoryGrinder can NOT access any files outside of the directory
> /writing_with_storygrinder, so initially you will have to copy or 
> move your .docx or .txt files into a project folder 
> ... for example:
> - create a new folder named: Moby Dick
> - ~/writing_with_storygrinder/MobyDick
> - copy a .docx of .txt of your book/novel/manuscript

1. Launch StoryGrinder
2. Click "Create New Project" 
3. Give your project a name (e.g., "My Novel")
4. Add your manuscript file (`.txt` or `.docx`)
5. Select a tool from the dropdown menu
6. Click "Setup & Run"

Your projects are stored in `~/writing_with_storygrinder/` on your computer. 
Each project gets its own folder with your manuscript(s) and all 
timestamped generated analysis files.
