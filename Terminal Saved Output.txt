AI Tools for Non-Fiction Writers

1. Artistic Integrity Analysis (Creative/Literary Non-Fiction)
Identifies elements that undermine a work's artistic authenticity, 
voice consistency, or emotional resonance. Examines forced language, 
artificial insights, metaphorical integrity, and structural coherence 
to ensure genuine creative expression.

2. Resonance and Completion Analysis (Creative/Literary Non-Fiction) 
Evaluates emotional and spiritual impact, identifying unrealized 
potential in metaphorical exploration, personal revelations, and 
cumulative meaning. Suggests ways to deepen reader engagement and 
achieve greater artistic completeness.

3. Conceptual Consistency Analysis (General Non-Fiction)
Checks for internal contradictions, argumentative integrity, and 
intellectual rigor. Identifies inconsistent claims, inadequate evidence, 
logical fallacies, and voice authority issues that undermine credibility.

4. Incomplete Development Analysis (General Non-Fiction)
Finds concepts, claims, or themes that are introduced but not fully developed. 
Examines underdeveloped arguments, incomplete examples, thematic threads, 
and structural gaps that leave readers unsatisfied.

5. Practical Effectiveness Analysis (Self-Help Non-Fiction)
Evaluates practical value for readers seeking personal improvement. 
Reviews solution clarity, accessibility barriers, safety concerns, and 
evidence credibility to ensure advice is implementable and trustworthy.

6. Reader Support Analysis (Self-Help Non-Fiction)
Identifies where readers might struggle, get confused, or lose motivation. 
Examines structural support, motivational gaps, practical logistics, and 
reader empowerment to optimize the personal development journey.
