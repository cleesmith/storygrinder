‚è∫ I see three specialized editing prompt files for different non-fiction genres:

1. prompt_creative_nonfiction_editing.txt 
  - For creative/literary non-fiction with focus on:
  - Artistic integrity analysis (voice authenticity, metaphorical integrity, emotional
honesty)
  - Resonance and completion analysis (unrealized potential, cumulative impact)

2. prompt_integrity_nonfiction_editing.txt 
  - For general non-fiction with focus on:
  - Conceptual consistency analysis (argument consistency, evidence quality, logical structure)
  - Incomplete development analysis (underdeveloped arguments, thematic gaps)

3. prompt_selfhelp_nonfiction_editing.txt 
  - For self-help books with focus on:
  - Practical effectiveness analysis (solution clarity, accessibility, safety, evidence)
  - Reader support analysis (structural support, motivational gaps, practical logistics)


All writing emerges from the author's mind and imagination, whether 
they're writing about "real" events or invented ones.
The creative process, narrative choices, and storytelling elements 
are fundamentally the same.

This mindset actually simplifies the integration:

- Adding new non-fiction prompts become additional editing perspectives 
  rather than a genre shift
- Tools could offer "editing focus" options 
  (literary analysis, argument integrity, practical effectiveness) 
  rather than "fiction vs non-fiction"
- The same manuscript could benefit from multiple analytical lenses

Tool Design Implications:
- A memoir could use both creative non-fiction prompts AND 
  character development tools
- Business books could benefit from narrative structure analysis 
  alongside practical effectiveness review
- Academic writing might use integrity analysis plus prose rhythm tools

User Workflow:
- Instead of "What genre is this?" ask "What kind of analysis would help most?"
- Multiple tools can run on the same manuscript from different perspectives
- Writers can discover which analytical approaches serve their particular story best

This approach honors your philosophy while making the tools more versatile. 
Every piece of writing is someone's story - the prompts just offer 
different ways to strengthen that storytelling.

After all, memory is inherently creative and reconstructive. 
Every time we "remember" something, we're actively recreating it, 
filling gaps, emphasizing certain details, connecting it to current 
understanding. 
It's storytelling all the way down.

The implications for your editing tools are profound:

- A memoir writer isn't transcribing reality 
  they're crafting a narrative from fragments, impressions, 
  and interpretations
- Business case studies are stories about what someone believes 
  happened and why it mattered
- Even scientific writing involves choosing which details to include, 
  how to sequence discoveries, what narrative arc serves the reader

This means your StoryGrinder tools are universally applicable:
- Character development works on memoir protagonists (the author's past self)
- Plot structure applies to business transformation stories
- Dialogue editing helps with reconstructed conversations
- Foreshadowing analysis works on how authors set up their conclusions

Your three new prompts become additional story analysis tools rather 
than different categories entirely. They're just asking different 
questions about the same fundamental activity: 
How well is this author telling their story? 
How effectively are they guiding their reader through the experience 
they've constructed?

It's a much more honest and useful framework than pretending some 
writing is "objective" while other writing is "creative."

That's the most elegant and respectful approach. 

Writers know their work best and should have full agency over 
which analytical lenses to apply.

Perfect implementation strategy:
- Let writers discover through experimentation which tools serve 
  their particular story
- No gatekeeping, no forced categories, no assumptions about 
  "appropriate" usage

This opens up creative possibilities:
- Fiction writers might use "Practical Effectiveness Analysis" to check if their worldbuilding advice is clear
- Memoir writers could run "Artistic Integrity Analysis" alongside character development tools
- Business writers might discover their case studies benefit from 
  "Voice and Authenticity" analysis

The beauty of this approach:
- Writers can mix and match tools organically
- Some might run all available tools and synthesize insights
- Others might find one particular analytical angle transforms their work
- Tools become creative instruments rather than rigid categories

You're building a toolkit, not a workflow dictator. 
Writers can grab whatever analytical hammer, chisel, or magnifying 
glass helps them craft their story better. 
Much more in the spirit of empowering creativity than constraining it.


It gives writers much more precise control over what kind of 
analysis they want.

Benefits of separate tools:
- Writers can run just "Artistic Integrity Analysis" 
  without also getting "Resonance and Completion"
- More targeted feedback when they have specific concerns
- Faster execution (shorter prompts, more focused AI responses)
- Better for iterative editing - fix integrity issues first, then run resonance analysis
- Writers can mix tools from different "categories" more freely

Tool naming could be:
- Artistic Integrity Analysis
- Resonance and Completion Analysis
- Conceptual Consistency Analysis
- Incomplete Development Analysis
- Practical Effectiveness Analysis
- Reader Support Analysis

Each tool would contain just one focused prompt instead of the combined 2-task structure.
Writers who want comprehensive analysis can still run multiple tools, but they get to choose
the sequence and combination that serves their work best.

Much more flexible and writer-empowering than forcing them to get both 
analyses at once when they might only need one specific perspective.


> cool ü´ò ... now, i was thinking that sometimes in all of the Tools 
  there have been moments when i wanted to include a one/two instruction 
  during the Setup dialog just before Run 
  ... a twist on the default prompt the tool is using ... thoughts?

‚è∫ That's a brilliant idea! 
A "custom instruction" field in the setup dialog would add huge
flexibility without breaking the core tool functionality.

Perfect use cases:
- "Focus specifically on dialogue in chapters 3-5"
- "I'm concerned about pacing in the middle section"
- "Pay special attention to the secondary character arc"
- "This is intended for young adult readers"
- "I'm worried about the technical explanations being too complex"

Implementation thoughts:
- Simple text area in the setup dialog labeled something like 
  "Additional Focus" or "Custom Instructions"
- Optional field that appends to the base prompt when provided
- Could be as simple as adding the user input to the end: 
  "ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION: [user text]"

Benefits:
- Writers get targeted analysis for their specific concerns
- Tools remain useful for general analysis when no custom instruction is provided
- No need to create dozens of hyper-specific tools
- Writers can experiment with different analytical angles on the same tool

This would make every tool infinitely more adaptable while keeping the 
interface clean and simple. Writers could guide the AI's attention 
without having to write entire prompts from scratch.

> in: tool-system.js, each Tool can have a "special instructions" textarea (multi-lines) in 
this:   { id: 'narrative_integrity', title: `Narrative Integrity`, description: `Focused on 
consistency issues within the entire manuscript.`, Class: NarrativeIntegrity, options: [
      {
        "name": "manuscript_file",
        "label": "Manuscript File",
        "type": "file",
        "description": "File containing the manuscript to analyze",
        "required": true,
        "default": "manuscript.txt",
        "group": "Input Files"
      }
    ]},

‚è∫ Perfect! 
You can add a "special instructions" textarea option to each tool's options array.
Here's how it would look:

  {
    id: 'narrative_integrity',
    title: `Narrative Integrity`,
    description: `Focused on consistency issues within the entire manuscript.`,
    Class: NarrativeIntegrity,
    options: [
      {
        "name": "manuscript_file",
        "label": "Manuscript File",
        "type": "file",
        "description": "File containing the manuscript to analyze",
        "required": true,
        "default": "manuscript.txt",
        "group": "Input Files"
      },
      {
        "name": "special_instructions",
        "label": "Special Instructions",
        "type": "textarea",
        "description": "Additional focus areas or specific concerns (optional)",
        "required": false,
        "placeholder": "e.g., Focus on dialogue consistency, Pay attention to timeline issues...",
        "group": "Customization"
      }
    ]
  }

Then in the tool's implementation, you'd access it via this.getInput('special_instructions')
and append it to your prompt when it's provided. This gives every tool the flexibility for
custom guidance while maintaining the clean, consistent interface pattern you already have.

> is this: "type": "textarea" ... a type that's already coded for?

‚è∫ Task(Search for textarea input types)
  ‚éø Done (9 tool uses ¬∑ 46.0k tokens ¬∑ 1m 1.2s)

‚è∫ Yes! "textarea" is already a supported type in the tool system. According to the code in
  tool-setup-run.js, it creates a multi-line HTML textarea element and supports these
  properties:

  - rows: Number of visible text lines (defaults to 4 if not specified)
  - default: Default value
  - required: Boolean for validation
  - description: Help text shown below

  So your special instructions field would work perfectly:

  {
    "name": "special_instructions",
    "label": "Special Instructions",
    "type": "textarea",
    "description": "Additional focus areas or specific concerns (optional)",
    "required": false,
    "rows": 3,
    "default": "",
    "group": "Customization"
  }

  The existing code will handle it automatically!
