> tell me again how to use forge/squirrel to build/dist on my windows laptop

⏺ Based on your project structure, you're using Electron Forge with 
  Squirrel.Windows. Here are the commands:

⏺ Read(package.json)…
  ⎿ Read 83 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ For Windows builds using Squirrel, run these commands in order:

  # Package the app (creates executable but no installer)
  npm run package

  # Create Windows installer using Squirrel
  npm run make

  The npm run make command will create a Squirrel-based installer in the
  out/make/squirrel.windows/ directory.

  If you need to build specifically for Windows from your laptop, ensure 
  you have the Windows build tools installed and use the platform-specific 
  flags if needed.

> and the result will be: .exe or .msi or ?

⏺ Read(forge.config.js)…
  ⎿ Read 47 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Based on your Electron Forge configuration, the Squirrel maker 
  will generate:

  .exe - A setup executable installer

  The noMsi: false setting means it can also optionally create an MSI package, but the primary
  output will be a .exe installer file.

  You'll find it in out/make/squirrel.windows/x64/ after running npm run make.


> and i do what with the .exe ... remember i'm not using App Store's or 
  code signing but distributing via the github repo: and i already have 
  the .dmg for Mac users ready

⏺ For GitHub repo distribution without code signing:

  1. Upload the .exe to GitHub Releases:
    - Create a new release on your GitHub repo
    - Attach the generated .exe file as a release asset
    - Name it something like StoryGrinder-2.0.0-Setup.exe
  2. Users download and install:
    - Users download the .exe from your GitHub releases page
    - They run the .exe installer
    - Windows will show security warnings (since it's unsigned)
    - Users click "More info" → "Run anyway" to proceed with installation
  3. In your README, add installation instructions:
    - Link to the releases page
    - Mention the security warning users will see
    - Explain it's safe to proceed despite the warning

  The .exe is a standard Windows installer that will handle installation, shortcuts, and
  uninstall entries automatically.
